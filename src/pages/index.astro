      <h3>The early years</h3>
      <p>My formal education was at ESAD. A theoretical introduction to design. The real education came after. My first job was at a small graphic shop. Logos, visual identities, print for local businesses. Small clients, real pressure. I took the work seriously from day one — probably more seriously than the context required. Typography mattered. Grids mattered. Production details mattered. Then came magazines. Low budgets, limited resources, same standard. I treated them as if they were cultural artifacts.</p>

      <h3>Going digital</h3>
      <p>In 2008 I made the first real shift. Left print. Moved fully into digital. I spent nine years at Portugalmail — Portugal's first email provider — designing email platforms and blogging products. The work was dense, functional, content-heavy. That's where I developed a real respect for the browser as a medium. HTML and CSS weren't constraints, they were material. It's also where I learned to work properly with engineers. Not as a handoff. As a shared surface.</p>

      <h3>Building from zero</h3>
      <p>I joined Namecheap as a founding designer when the product was still an idea. For six years I helped build Spaceship from the ground up. Design systems, cross-functional alignment, documentation that translates intent into buildable reality. The highest-leverage work of my career. The stakes were real. So were the outcomes.</p>

    </div>
    <p>I'm from Porto, Portugal. I've been designing digital products for over 15 years, long enough to have lived through most of the paradigm shifts — the web, mobile, social, and now AI. I think carefully about the things I make. I care about craft the way some people care about music — not just whether it works, but whether it feels right. Just reach out if you feel we should.</p>
