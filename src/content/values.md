title: "Values"

I believe good digital products are built through structure, clarity, and intent.
I care about how systems think and communicate — not just how they look.
About rhythm, hierarchy, and constraint.
About reducing noise until what matters becomes obvious.
Design is not about adding layers.
It’s about making decisions.
