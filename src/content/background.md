title: "Background"

Born and raised in Porto, Portugal. Started in the arts—music, performance, theater—which taught me about rhythm, presence, and how structure creates meaning. That foundation shaped how I think about design: not decoration, but intentional systems that guide people naturally.

Moved into design through web and print work. Learned early that clarity matters more than cleverness. Spent years building that discipline—studying typography, grid systems, semantic HTML, understanding how information architecture shapes behavior.

Joined Spaceship in 2019 when it was just an idea. Spent 6 years building it from scratch—4 years to launch, 2 more years refining based on real user feedback. That experience taught me what it actually takes to ship complex products: disciplined documentation, clear specifications, and the ability to translate ambiguous requirements into concrete systems that engineering can build.

Now looking for what's next. Ideally an early-stage AI startup (seed to Series A) where I can use this experience to help shape product from the ground up.
