title: "Background"

Raised in Porto, Portugal, my journey began in the arts and evolved into design. Over the years I’ve navigated between creativity and structure, developing a natural sense of presence and movement. My story is shaped by a deep connection to family, culture and a commitment to continuous improvement.
