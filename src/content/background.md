### Ink and paper first.
My formal education was at ESAD. A theoretical introduction to design. The real education came after.
My first job was at a small graphic shop. Logos, visual identities, print for local businesses. Small clients, real pressure. I took the work seriously from day one — probably more seriously than the context required. Typography mattered. Grids mattered. Production details mattered.
Then came magazines. Low budgets, limited resources, same standard. I treated them as if they were cultural artifacts.

### Nine years inside the browser.
In 2008 I made the first real shift. Left print. Moved fully into digital. I spent nine years at Portugalmail — Portugal's first email provider — designing email platforms and blogging products. The work was dense, functional, content-heavy. That's where I developed a real respect for the browser as a medium. HTML and CSS weren't constraints, they were material. It's also where I learned to work properly with engineers. Not as a handoff. As a shared surface.

### The second shift.
In 2017 came the second shift. UX had matured and I wanted to know what the hype was all about.
I joined Namecheap as a founding designer when the product was still an idea. For six years I helped build Spaceship from the ground up. Design systems, cross-functional alignment, documentation that translates intent into buildable reality. The highest-leverage work of my career. The stakes were real. So were the outcomes.
