### I'm Luís, thank you for stopping by.

I live and work in Porto, the second largest city of Portugal. I have been designing digital products for 18 years now, so, I can I lived lived through some significant paradigm shifts — the blogging era, the social web, the internet in your pocket, and UX earning its place at the table. I truly believe these different experiences/vibes shape the designer i am today... and that makes me stronger.

Cutting it short, I’m a designer who thrives in designing systems, user experiences, internal experiences, design documentation, cross-functional work, and high-level starting from zero, providing the 1, and decisive improvements fed from the first real-world feedbacks.

With this website I aim to introduce myself to a bigger audience and, who knows, improve the chances of meeting great people.

So, what are you waiting for?... [HIT ME UP](mailto:luis@luisvieira.design)
