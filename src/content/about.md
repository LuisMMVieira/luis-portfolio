title: "About Me"
---

I’m a Senior Digital Product Designer focused on creating clear, purposeful digital products. My work lives at the intersection of design, product and technology — balancing thoughtful systems, practical execution and meaningful experiences. My background began in the arts and evolved into design, shaped by a lifelong drive to create, learn and perform. Culturally, I’m inspired by minds like Nirvana, Picasso, Paula Scher, Stanley Kubrick and Ricky Gervais. Originally from Porto, I remain deeply connected to its culture and pace of life.
