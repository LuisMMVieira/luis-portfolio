### I'm Luís, thank you for stopping by

I'm from Porto, Portugal. I've been designing digital products for over 15 years, long enough to have lived through most of the paradigm shifts — the web, mobile, social, and now AI. I think carefully about the things I make. I care about craft the way some people care about music — not just whether it works, but whether it feels right. Just reach out if you feel we should.
