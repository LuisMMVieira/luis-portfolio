title: "About Me"

I'm a Senior Digital Product Designer with 8+ years building digital products that work. Currently at Spaceship, where I was core to building the platform from zero over 6 years. Before that, I spent years in web and print design, learning how structure and clarity create meaning.

I think in systems. I document obsessively. I bridge the gap between design intent and engineering reality through specs that teams can actually build from. My strength is making complex things buildable—not through cleverness, but through disciplined thinking and clear communication.

I'm looking for my next role at an early-stage AI startup where design is a strategic advantage, not an afterthought. If you're building something hard and need someone who can think through the entire system—not just paint pixels—let's talk.
