I’m a Senior Digital Product Designer focused on creating clear, purposeful digital products. My work lives at the intersection of design, product and technology — balancing thoughtful systems, practical execution and meaningful experiences. My background began in the arts and evolved into design, shaped by a lifelong drive to create, learn and perform.

I’m always open to new collaborations and conversations. If you would like to work together or simply say hello, feel free to reach out via email.
