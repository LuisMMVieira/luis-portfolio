intro: |
  I was core to building Spaceship from scratch—a 4-year build to launch, with 2 more years refining with users. The domains and hosting industry was stuck in the past. We built a modern product platform with UX at the center.

  I worked across the full design cycle: concept, definition, UI. I helped build the system and fabric that Spaceship runs on today.

## Contextual Guides—Rethinking help

Spaceship's support team was sharing Namecheap knowledgebase links as a temporary solution—functional, but disconnected from our product. We needed help that lived inside the platform, adapting to where users were and what they were trying to do.

I designed a contextual guide system with multiple entry points: in-app help buttons, triggered guides based on user actions, global search, and chat integration. Each path surfaces the right information at the right moment, eliminating the friction of leaving the product to find answers.
