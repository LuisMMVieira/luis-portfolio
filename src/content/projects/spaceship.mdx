intro: |
  I was core to building Spaceship from scratch—a 4-year build to launch, with 2 more years refining with users. The domains and hosting industry was stuck in the past. We built a modern product platform with UX at the center.

  I worked across the full design cycle: concept, definition, UI. I helped build the system and fabric that Spaceship runs on today.

## [Exploration & Defining direction]

Before building anything, we had to figure out what we were actually building. The product brief was ambitious but abstract—create a modern hosting platform that doesn't make people feel lost. I started by mapping the invisible: pricing logic, bundle combinations, edge cases in flows that nobody had documented yet.

These early sketches became the foundation for every feature we shipped. They weren't pretty—they were tools for thinking through complexity before it became concrete.

## [Definition & closing the gaps]

Once we knew what to build, the work shifted to making it buildable. I translated conceptual flows into complete system specifications—every path, every conditional, every state transition documented. These weren't just diagrams for stakeholders. They were the engineering blueprint.

This is where systems thinking becomes practical: defining how components behave across viewports, documenting state logic, mapping the full journey from search to purchase to configuration.

## Contextual Guides—Rethinking help

Spaceship's support team was sharing Namecheap knowledgebase links as a temporary solution—functional, but disconnected from our product. We needed help that lived inside the platform, adapting to where users were and what they were trying to do.

I designed a contextual guide system with multiple entry points: in-app help buttons, triggered guides based on user actions, global search, and chat integration. Each path surfaces the right information at the right moment, eliminating the friction of leaving the product to find answers.

## Documentation—Bridging design and engineering

Complex systems need clear communication. At Spaceship, I developed a documentation approach that became the bridge between design intent and engineering implementation—turning ambiguous requirements into buildable specifications that teams could trust.
