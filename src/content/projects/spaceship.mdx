<PostHeader title="Spaceship" subtitle="Building a domain platform from scratch. Six years and counting.">

Spaceship is Namecheap's from-scratch platform: a full rebuild of how domains, hosting, email, and connected products work together. Not a reskin. A new product.

I was one of the core product designers from day one. Over six years, I designed the search experience, the domain manager, the Unbox connection system, and the documentation that held it all together across teams. Pretty much everything users touch, I had a hand in.
