<PostHeader title="Building a domain platform from scratch—Six years and counting.">

Spaceship.com is a spin-off from Namecheap. They rhyme but they're essentially different. Spaceship's goal was to revolutionize the online presence experience through unparallel user experience, getting itself ahead in the industry.

This journey started in 2019 and I, as a founding designer, had my contribution on almost every part of its design. Everything you see final here is work done by me and my team—Product Platform UX team.
