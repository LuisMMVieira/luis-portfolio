<PostHeader title="Spaceship" subtitle="Building a domain platform from scratch. Six years and counting.">

Spaceship is Namecheap's from-scratch platform: a full rebuild of how domains, hosting, email, and connected products work together. Not a reskin. A new product.

I was one of the core product designers from day one. Over six years, I designed the search experience, the domain manager, the Unbox connection system, and the documentation that held it all together across teams. Pretty much everything users touch, I had a hand in.

    Complex products need clear infrastructure. I mapped connection flows across 12+ scenarios, built and evolved the design system for the platform foundations that scaled across web and mobile, and documented everything so engineering could build it. This is the work that turns ideas into shippable systems.

    Spaceship launched in 2021 and now serves users across 150+ countries. The platform handles thousands of domains daily, and the design system I built scaled across web, mobile, and multiple product lines.

    Building a 0→1 product over 8 years taught me how to design for uncertainty, build systems that scale, and stay close to users through launch and beyond. The biggest lesson: the best interfaces are the ones users don't notice—they just get their work done.
