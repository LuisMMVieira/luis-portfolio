## Overview

Multi-year work across navigation, system architecture, and UI frameworks. Building the core product experience for Spaceship's hosting and domain management platform.

## Key Contributions

- **Design System**: Built and maintained the component library used across all products
- **UI Architecture**: Established patterns for consistent user interfaces

## Results

The new navigation reduced support tickets related to "finding features" by 40% and improved task completion rates across the platform.
