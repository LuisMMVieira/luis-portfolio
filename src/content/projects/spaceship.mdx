intro: |
  I was core to building Spaceship from scratch—a 4-year build to launch, with 2 more years refining with users. The domains and hosting industry was stuck in the past. We built a modern product platform with UX at the center.

  I worked across the full design cycle: concept, definition, UI. I helped build the system and fabric that Spaceship runs on today.
